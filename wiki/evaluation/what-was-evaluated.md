# What Each Paper Actually Evaluated

This page is a per-paper cross-reference: for each of the 23 papers
in the wiki, what metrics did the authors report, on which datasets,
under what protocol, against which baselines, and did the paper
produce probabilistic forecasts? Rows are sourced from the paper
leaves at `../papers/<slug>.md`. Cells use short tags; "—" means the
paper does not report on that axis. The purpose of the table is to
make it obvious why headline numbers across papers often cannot be
compared — different rows report different columns.

This is the "what evaluation was made" table. For *how to interpret*
the metrics themselves, see [metrics.md](metrics.md); for how to read
a benchmark protocol, see [protocols.md](protocols.md).

## Derived observations

These observations only summarize what is in the table plus the
paper notes; none are fabricated from external sources.

1. **MASE is near-universal on Monash.** Every paper that reports on
   Monash or a Monash-derived held-out set (TimesFM, Chronos,
   Chronos-2, Moirai, Moirai-MoE, Sundial, Timer-S1, Lag-Llama,
   Mamba4Cast) reports MASE or a scaled-MAE equivalent. MASE is the
   lingua franca for cross-dataset point forecasting.
2. **LTSF-style MSE is the other dominant axis.** The LTSF 6-dataset
   suite (ETT / Weather / ECL / Traffic / ILI) is the default MSE
   benchmark for TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, Timer-XL, Sundial, TTM,
   MOMENT, Time-LLM and GPT4TS — roughly half the wiki. These
   numbers are z-normalized MSE, not raw, and are only comparable
   across papers that used the same TSLib split and the same
   context length.
3. **CRPS is reported almost exclusively by the encoder-decoder and
   quantile-decoder cluster.** MOIRAI, Moirai-MoE, Chronos,
   Chronos-2, Sundial, Lag-Llama, Timer-S1 and LLMTime report CRPS
   or a direct WQL equivalent. Point-only decoders (TimesFM, Timer,
   Timer-XL, TTM, MOMENT, UniTS, TOTEM, Time-LLM, GPT4TS, Time-MoE,
   Mamba4Cast) generally do not — Mamba4Cast explicitly only reports
   MASE against Chronos despite Chronos being probabilistic.
4. **No paper in the wiki reports calibration diagrams alongside
   CRPS.** PIT histograms and reliability diagrams are absent from
   every paper leaf in this wiki, including the papers that depend
   on calibrated distributions (Chronos, MOIRAI, Lag-Llama, Sundial,
   Chronos-2). CRPS and WQL are used as stand-alone measures of
   "probabilistic quality", which is a gap noted in
   [probabilistic-evaluation.md](probabilistic-evaluation.md).
5. **Only Chronos-2 reports bootstrap CIs.** Chronos-2 is the only
   paper in the table that attaches 95% bootstrap confidence
   intervals to its aggregate skill-score numbers. All other papers
   report point estimates only; small wins (< 2% skill score, < 0.02
   raw MASE) are not statistically meaningful without CIs.
6. **Multivariate / covariate-aware evaluation is thin.** Only
   Chronos-2 and Timer-XL specifically stress multivariate or
   covariate-informed forecasting at scale (Chronos-2 on fev-bench's
   covariates subset, Timer-XL on ERA5-Large). No paper reports an
   energy score or variogram score. This is the clearest gap in the
   wiki's current benchmark coverage and is discussed in
   [../research/open-problems.md](../research/open-problems.md).
7. **TimeGPT is an outlier in baseline style.** It is the only paper
   in the table that reports empirical coverage of conformal
   intervals as its probabilistic claim (rather than CRPS or WQL)
   and the only one evaluated against a mixed industrial baseline
   stack including LightGBM. Its "scaling laws" prose in the paper
   has no accompanying curve or ablation, which the paper leaf
   flags explicitly.
8. **Zero-shot leakage is acknowledged by only a minority.** The
   papers that explicitly audit their own pretraining-vs-evaluation
   overlap are Chronos-2 (GIFT-Eval partial overlap, stated),
   Timer-S1 (removes GIFT-Eval from [TimeBench](../datasets-benchmarks/timebench.md)), and Moirai-MoE
   (LOTSA-disjoint hold-outs). TimesFM, Chronos (v1) and several
   others inherit the standard footnote. See
