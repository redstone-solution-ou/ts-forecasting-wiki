## Abstract
TOTEM learns a cross-domain discrete time-series codebook via a VQ-VAE and evaluates both specialist and generalist models on top of it at scale. It argues that discrete-token TS pretraining is a principled alternative to raw continuous patches and shows the same codebook supports imputation, anomaly detection, and forecasting across many domains.

## Key contributions
- VQ-VAE-based cross-domain codebook for time-series tokens, with a 1D strided convolutional encoder / decoder and exclusively temporal (not spatial) quantisation.
- Systematic comparison of specialist (one domain) versus generalist (many domains) training on the shared codebook, across 3 tasks, with 14-19 baselines per task and up to 25 evaluation datasets.
- Demonstration that the learned codebook transfers zero-shot to held-out domains (neuroscience, river flow, sunspots, birth rate) without fine-tuning the tokenizer.
- Case against hand-engineered Fourier features and domain-specific preprocessing: only RevIN is used for normalisation, no frequency-space tricks.

## Architecture at a glance
TOTEM trains a convolutional VQ-VAE whose codebook provides a discrete vocabulary for time-series patches. The encoder is a stack of strided 1D convolutions with dilation 1 so every time step contributes; the decoder mirrors it with transposed convolutions. Downstream transformers then consume the resulting token sequences for each task. The tokenizer is frozen after pretraining and reused across specialists and generalists. Tokens are VQ-VAE discrete codes from a learned codebook; downstream prediction operates over these discrete token sequences rather than continuous patches (Talukder et al. Section 3).

## Why it matters
TOTEM anchors the discrete-tokenisation branch of TS foundation models. By quantifying specialist-versus-generalist trade-offs with a common codebook, it motivates subsequent approaches that combine VQ-style tokenisation with universal pretraining objectives and provides the cleanest evidence that a learned (rather than uniformly binned) discrete vocabulary is viable across many TS domains.

## Strengths
- The evaluation is unusually thorough: ~500 experiments covering imputation (17 baselines, 12 datasets), anomaly detection (19 baselines, 25 datasets), and forecasting (14 baselines, 12 datasets), in both specialist and generalist settings.
- Zero-shot evaluation is on held-out domains with no shared sampling rate or sensor count with the training data (neuro 2 ms, river flow daily, birth rate daily), which is a stricter test than most TS zero-shot papers run.
- Motivates the learned codebook over uniform bucketing or histogram binning by arguing that a deterministic, reversible encoder is more information-preserving than scalar quantisation.
- Shows that the same architecture suffices for all three tasks using simple, generic downstream models, supporting the claim that the codebook itself carries most of the transferable signal.
- The generalist VQ-VAE outperforms the concurrent MOMENT model on the limited subset of shared benchmarks.

## Limitations and open critiques
- Accuracy is competitive but rarely dominant: TOTEM "matches or outperforms" SOTAs rather than decisively surpassing them, and the headline MSE improvements are single-digit percentages.
- VQ-VAE codebook collapse and under-utilisation are known pathologies that the paper does not deeply analyse; hyperparameters that prevent collapse in vision may not transfer to noisy TS.
- Sundial argues that all discrete-tokenisation approaches (TOTEM, Chronos, LLMTime) throw away structure that flow-matching on continuous values preserves, and reports substantial point-forecast gains from dropping discretisation.
- The codebook is trained separately from downstream tasks, so the tokenizer cannot adapt its vocabulary to the forecasting or classification objective at hand; Chronos sidesteps this by training the T5 and the vocabulary end-to-end.
- Model sizes and training compute are not benchmarked against recent billion-parameter TS-FMs, so TOTEM's position on the accuracy-efficiency Pareto is unclear.

## Follow-up work and dialogue
TOTEM and [Chronos](./chronos.md) are the two canonical answers to "how to discretise time series": TOTEM uses a learned VQ-VAE codebook on top of raw values, while Chronos uses scalar uniform quantisation (min-max binning) into a fixed vocabulary consumed by a T5. Chronos argues simpler is better when paired with enough data; TOTEM argues the representation should be learned end-to-end. [LLMTime](./llmtime.md) is a third data point — it uses a text LLM's existing BPE over digit strings, neither uniform nor learned. [Sundial](./sundial.md) rejects all three by going continuous via flow-matching. TOTEM also sits adjacent to [UniTS](./units.md) and [MOMENT](./moment.md) in the multi-task/universal cluster.

## Reproducibility
- **Open weights:** yes — the paper states pretrained codebooks and downstream models are released.
- **Code:** public repo stated as `https://github.com/SaberaTalukder/TOTEM`.
- **Training data:** public corpora only (Weather, Traffic, Electricity, ETT variants for forecasting/imputation; SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, PSM for anomaly detection). Zero-shot held-out domains enumerated in the appendix.
- **Compute to retrain:** not disclosed as GPU-hours; the paper emphasises minimal engineering and standard VQ-VAE training.
- **Deployment footprint:** codebook plus small convolutional encoder/decoder; downstream transformers are "simple, generic"; no CPU-inference numbers reported.

## When to cite this paper
Cite TOTEM as the canonical reference for a learned VQ-VAE codebook as the tokeniser of a TS foundation model, for the systematic specialist-versus-generalist comparison at scale, and as the direct point of comparison to Chronos whenever the question is learned versus uniform discretisation.
