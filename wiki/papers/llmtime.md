## Abstract
LLMTime shows that off-the-shelf large language models such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can forecast time series zero-shot when numerical values are encoded as carefully formatted text. A token-level distribution over digits is converted into a continuous predictive density, matching or exceeding purpose-built TS models on several benchmarks without any fine-tuning.

## Key contributions
- Numbers-as-text tokenisation scheme (digit-by-digit with explicit separators) designed to avoid BPE-induced misalignment between numerical characters and tokens.
- Change-of-variables construction that turns a hierarchical softmax over digit strings into a flexible continuous mixture density, enabling proper NLL and [CRPS](../evaluation/metrics.md#21-crps--continuous-ranked-probability-score) evaluation.
- Evidence that vanilla GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 match or exceed purpose-built TS models zero-shot on Darts, M4, and Informer benchmarks.
- Observation that GPT-4 sometimes underperforms GPT-3, attributed to its number tokenizer and to alignment/RLHF artefacts; base models fit the MMLU-to-forecasting scaling curve, chat-tuned models do not.
- Demonstrations that LLMs can handle missing values via textual markers (`NaN`) and accept textual side information.

## Architecture at a glance
LLMTime uses unmodified pretrained LLMs as forecasters. Numeric series are serialised into digit-level text with spaces between digits and commas between timesteps; decimals are dropped under a fixed-precision convention. Sampling next-token distributions and reversing the serialisation yields a mixture of per-bin uniform densities, which the paper shows can represent heavy-tailed and multimodal distributions competitively against GMMs and fixed bins. Tokenization is at the per-digit level (1 text token per digit); forecasting is autoregressive digit-by-digit via the frozen LLM, with each numerical value serialized as a string of individual digit tokens (Gruver et al. Section 3).

### Why digit-level tokenisation with explicit separators

Standard BPE tokenizers used by GPT-2, LLaMA, and GPT-4 merge frequent digit substrings (`42`, `235`, `1024`) into single tokens, destroying the alignment between token positions and numerical place values — the model can no longer treat next-token prediction as next-digit prediction (paper §2 Background, Figure 2). LLMTime forces one token per digit by inserting spaces between digits and commas between timesteps so the BPE merger cannot fire across digits. The trick is necessary, not cosmetic: GPT-4's "improved" number tokenizer actually *breaks* the method (paper §3 reports GPT-4 underperforming GPT-3 on the same series) while LLaMA-2 with the right space-handling convention works well. Once each digit is its own token, the **change-of-variables construction** in §3 turns the softmax over the resulting digit string into a proper continuous mixture density of per-bin uniform components — which is what enables NLL and CRPS evaluation rather than only point forecasts. The whole method is a careful tokenizer adapter plus a sampler; nothing else.

## Why it matters
LLMTime provided a provocative zero-shot baseline showing that language models trained only on text already contain enough sequence structure to forecast numeric time series. It crystallised the discrete-tokenisation-of-values idea and is the canonical counterexample to the view that TS forecasting requires TS-specific pretraining.

## Strengths
- Truly zero-shot: no fine-tuning, no adapter, no dataset-specific code — the method is essentially a careful string formatter plus a sampler, which makes it trivially reproducible over any text LLM.
- Provides proper probabilistic forecasts with NLL and CRPS, not just point predictions, by converting digit distributions into a continuous density — something reprogramming methods like GPT4TS and Time-LLM lack.
- Demonstrates a clean monotone relationship between underlying LLM quality (MMLU accuracy, LLaMA size) and forecasting quality, supporting the compressor-as-forecaster hypothesis.
- Graceful missing-value handling via literal `NaN` tokens; no imputation required.
- Natural path to text-conditioned forecasting, where textual side information is concatenated in the prompt, which most TS-FMs cannot do at all.

## Limitations and open critiques
- The per-step cost is enormous: each forecast horizon step requires sampling several digit tokens from a 7B-70B LLM, so LLMTime is one to three orders of magnitude slower than purpose-built forecasters (the [TTM](./ttm.md) paper reports LLMTime at thousands of seconds on CPU for benchmarks where TTM runs in milliseconds).
- Digit-level text tokenisation is brittle: GPT-4 performs worse than GPT-3 because its tokenizer merges digit groups differently, and LLaMA needs the opposite space handling from GPT. This is fundamentally a tokenizer hack, not a principled encoder.
- Zero-shot accuracy saturates at the level of a decent PatchTST on standard TSLib benchmarks; Chronos and later TS-native models substantially exceed it with purpose-built vocabularies.
- Uncertainty calibration degrades under RLHF/chat alignment, so the approach is incompatible with most production LLM endpoints.
- Strictly univariate and memory-limited by the LLM's context window, with no native mechanism for cross-channel dependencies.

## Follow-up work and dialogue
[Chronos](./chronos.md) is the direct response: LLMTime showed the value of a discrete-digit vocabulary, but Chronos argues a purpose-built T5 with a fixed bin vocabulary is strictly better than hijacking a text tokenizer. Both discretise values; LLMTime uses text digits through a frozen general LLM while Chronos trains a TS-specific T5 with a dedicated bin vocabulary. [Sundial](./sundial.md) attacks both: its TimeFlow objective argues that any discretisation (LLMTime, Chronos) throws away continuous structure that flow-matching can preserve. [GPT4TS](./gpt4ts.md) and [Time-LLM](./time-llm.md) represent the opposite reprogramming response, keeping the LLM as a backbone rather than a text interface.

## Reproducibility
- **Open weights:** not applicable — the method uses off-the-shelf public LLMs (LLaMA-2, LLaMA, GPT-3/4) plus a serialiser.
- **Code:** public repo referenced in paper at `https://github.com/ngruver/llmtime`.
- **Training data:** none — LLMTime is fully zero-shot. Evaluation uses the Darts, [Monash](../datasets-benchmarks/monash-archive.md), and Informer benchmark collections.
- **Compute to retrain:** no training; inference cost is dominated by LLM API calls / local forward passes of a 7B-70B model per serialised window.
- **Deployment footprint:** bounded by the underlying LLM; the paper evaluates up to LLaMA-2 70B and GPT-4. Latency is high relative to purpose-built TS models — the TTM paper measures ~2500 s CPU for a comparable evaluation setting.

## When to cite this paper
Cite LLMTime as the canonical reference for zero-shot time-series forecasting with an unmodified text LLM, for the digit-tokenisation-plus-change-of-variables recipe that converts next-token distributions into continuous densities, and for the specific observation that alignment/RLHF and BPE tokenisers degrade numerical forecasting.
