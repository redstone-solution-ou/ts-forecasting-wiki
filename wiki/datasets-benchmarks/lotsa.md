# LOTSA

LOTSA (Large-scale Open Time Series Archive) is the pretraining corpus assembled by Salesforce for MOIRAI. It contains roughly 27 billion observations drawn from 9 broad domains, making it one of the largest publicly described open time-series corpora and a key enabler of frequency-aware masked-encoder pretraining.

## Overview

LOTSA was built specifically to support a single foundation model that can handle a wide range of frequencies, domains, and variate structures without per-domain specialization. The 9-domain coverage is chosen to span the kinds of dynamics TS models have to handle in production: energy, transport, climate/weather, sales, web metrics, and other operational-data categories. Series are available at multiple sampling frequencies, from sub-hourly to yearly, and the corpus is assembled as an open resource so that downstream work can reuse it.

MOIRAI uses LOTSA as its sole pretraining corpus and leverages the multi-frequency coverage by attaching multiple input projections keyed by patch size, so that the model learns distinct parameters for different frequency regimes. The masked-encoder objective, together with LOTSA's breadth, yields strong zero-shot numbers on Monash and GIFT-Eval. Moirai-MoE then inherits LOTSA for pretraining but drops the explicit frequency projections in favor of token-level mixture-of-experts routing, arguing that the corpus is large and diverse enough to let the router discover frequency specialization on its own.

LOTSA's main contribution relative to older TS corpora is scale-per-domain: earlier benchmarks like Monash contain diverse datasets but only hundreds of millions of observations, and many published FM pretraining mixtures are opaque blends of private data. LOTSA is explicit, large, and reproducible.
