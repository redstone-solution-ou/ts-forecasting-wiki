# Evaluation Benchmarks in Current Use

This page catalogs every evaluation benchmark a TS foundation model
is expected to report on, with its purpose, scale, zero-shot status,
and whether it is actively used or retained only for historical
continuity.

If you want head-to-head *numbers*, see
[../benchmarks/leaderboard.md](../benchmarks/leaderboard.md). This
page is about the suites themselves — *what* each benchmark measures
and *why* you would report it.

## 1. The current SOTA benchmarks (2025-2026)

### GIFT-Eval

- **Paper.** Aksu et al., "GIFT-Eval: A Benchmark For General Time
  Series Forecasting Model Evaluation", arXiv:2410.10393.
- **Year introduced.** 2024.
- **Scale.** 23 test datasets / 144k series / 177M observations, 7
  domains, 10 frequencies (GIFT-Eval Tables 3-5).
- **Zero-shot status.** Zero-shot **by construction** — paired with a
  separate `GiftEvalPretrain` (88 datasets / 4.5M series / 230B obs,
  disjoint from the test split) so models can be trained and
  evaluated fairly.
- **Metrics.** MASE (point), WQL and CRPS (probabilistic), aggregated
  as skill scores vs Seasonal Naive (higher better).
- **Access.** `Salesforce/GiftEval` on HuggingFace; leaderboard at
  `Salesforce/GIFT-Eval` HuggingFace Space.
- **Use today.** The de facto SOTA zero-shot leaderboard. Every new
  TS-FM paper reports it. See [gift-eval.md](gift-eval.md) for the
  full dataset list.

### fev-bench

- **Paper.** Shchur et al., "fev-bench: A realistic benchmark for
  time series forecasting models" (arXiv:2509.26468, 2025).
- **Scale.** The fev-bench paper abstract states "100 forecasting
  tasks across seven domains, including 46 with covariates".
  [Chronos-2](../papers/chronos-2.md) §5.2 splits these 100 tasks
  into three analytic subsets: **32 univariate** (single target, no
  covariates), **26 multivariate** (multiple targets, no covariates),
  and **42 covariates** (at least one past-only or known covariate).
- **Metric.** Scaled Quantile Loss skill score (higher better), plus
  median runtime per task, plus a **Leakage (%)** column reporting
  per-baseline overlap with the eval set ([Chronos-2](../papers/chronos-2.md)
  Table 3: Chronos-2 0%, TiRex 1%, TimesFM-2.5 8%, Toto-1.0 8%,
  Moirai-2.0 28%, Sundial 1%, Chronos-Bolt 0%, TabPFN-TS 0%,
  COSMIC 0%).
- **Use today.** The current leaderboard for **covariate-informed
  and multivariate forecasting** — the axis GIFT-Eval under-weights.

### Chronos Benchmark II

- **Paper.** [Chronos](../papers/chronos.md) (Ansari et al., 2024),
  Appendix B / Table 3.
- **Scale.** 27 zero-shot datasets, short-context emphasis.
- **Zero-shot status.** Strict — explicitly held out during
  [Chronos](../papers/chronos.md) and
  [Chronos-2](../papers/chronos-2.md) pretraining. Chronos §5
  footnote 5 (verbatim): *"From a rigorous standpoint, to prevent
  information leakage, the start time of any dataset within this
  category must be after the timestamp of the last observation from
  the pretraining dataset and Benchmark I. Nevertheless, we consider
  the risk to be minimal given that the datasets bear no overlap
  beyond high-level conceptual categorization."*
- **Metrics.** MASE skill score, WQL skill score.
- **Use today.** Still widely reported, especially for short-context
  univariate probabilistic work. Note that the 2024-era numbers are
  comparable across `Chronos` family papers only if the evaluation
  protocol matches.

## 2. Historical benchmarks still in common use

### Monash Time Series Forecasting Archive

- **Paper.** Godahewa et al., 2021 (NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks).
- **Scale.** Dozens of datasets across energy, transport, weather,
  retail, finance, tourism. Most TS-FM papers report on a "standard
  Monash benchmark" subset that varies by paper; [Moirai-MoE](../papers/moirai-moe.md)
  Figure 3 reports on 29 datasets, which is the most commonly
  cited-as-canonical subset.
- **Zero-shot status.** **Complicated.** Monash ships fixed splits,
  but because LOTSA, Time-300B, the Time Series Pile, and the
  [Chronos](../papers/chronos.md) corpus all include Monash datasets,
  most foundation models that report Monash numbers are **in-corpus,
  not zero-shot**. [Moirai-MoE](../papers/moirai-moe.md) Figure 3
  asterisks TimesFM*, Chronos-Small/Base/Large* for this reason:
  "asterisks (*) to mark the methods that used the evaluation
  datasets here in their pretraining corpora."
- **Metrics.** MAE scaled by Seasonal Naive, geometric-mean
  aggregated. Classical and supervised deep-learning baselines are
  published alongside.
- **Use today.** Universally reported for historical continuity.
  Always read the asterisk footnote.

### LTSF (Long-Horizon Long-Term Series Forecasting)

- **Source.** Informer / Autoformer / TSLib literature (2021-2023).
- **Datasets.** ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electrical transformer
  temperatures), Weather, Electricity, Traffic.
- **Canonical horizons.** {96, 192, 336, 720} prediction steps.
- **Metrics.** Raw MSE and MAE averaged over the four horizons. No
  standardized probabilistic metric.
- **Zero-shot status.** In-corpus for most modern TS-FMs because the
  ETT / Weather / ECL datasets are heavily used in pretraining.
  Papers reporting "zero-shot LTSF" usually mean the specific
  test-window was held out; the series itself was seen during
  training.
- **Use today.** Still reported by every TS-FM paper, but treat the
  numbers as "long-horizon recall of seen series" rather than a
  zero-shot claim.

### TSLib family

Same ETT / Weather / ECL / ILI as LTSF, with the original PatchTST /
TimesNet / Autoformer evaluation conventions. Mostly obsolete for
new TS-FMs; still cited by the LLM-reprogramming subfield
([Time-LLM](../papers/time-llm.md), [GPT4TS](../papers/gpt4ts.md)).

## 3. Benchmarks for non-forecasting tasks

These are adjacent to TS-FM research but not used for forecasting
evaluation:

- **UCR / UEA Archives.** Univariate and multivariate classification
  — used by [MOMENT](../papers/moment.md), UniTS,
  [TSPulse](../papers/tspulse.md).
- **TSB-UAD / TSB-AD.** Time-series anomaly-detection benchmarks.
  TSPulse reports on TSB-AD; MOMENT reports on TSB-UAD.
- **LTSF-Imputation.** Imputation on the LTSF datasets with missing
  windows.

## 4. Retired or narrow-use benchmarks

- **M1 / M2 / M3 Competitions.** Listed in dataset cards for
  historical completeness; only "M4 (hourly/daily/monthly/...)"
  survives in current benchmarks.
- **"LTSF96/192/336/720" reported on Traffic.** The Traffic dataset
  is now considered saturated — most TS-FMs achieve near-identical
  MSE — so it rarely discriminates between models.
- **Paper-specific suites.** TimeGPT's 300k-series internal suite,
  MOIRAI's Table 5 "6-dataset CRPS", Moirai-MoE's "10-dataset
  held-out" are useful inside the parent paper but should not be
  quoted as generic benchmarks.

## 5. What a 2026 TS-FM paper is expected to report

Minimum viable set:

1. **GIFT-Eval test** with MASE + WQL skill scores.
2. Either **fev-bench** (if your model supports multivariate or
   covariates) or **Chronos Benchmark II** (if your model is
   strict-zero-shot univariate probabilistic).
3. **Monash** for continuity (asterisk it if your corpus overlaps).
4. **LTSF** for long-horizon sanity-check on ETT/Weather/ECL.

See [../evaluation/what-was-evaluated.md](../evaluation/what-was-evaluated.md)
for the exact evaluation setup each published paper uses.

## 6. Why the leakage audit matters here

Every "zero-shot" claim is paper-relative. Before quoting a number
from this page's benchmarks against a model trained on LOTSA /
Time-300B / Time Series Pile / the Chronos corpus, cross-reference
[leakage-map.md](leakage-map.md) — it tabulates exactly which
pretraining corpus overlaps which benchmark.

The actionable rule: if you want a clean zero-shot GIFT-Eval claim,
train on `Salesforce/GiftEvalPretrain` (the test-disjoint LOTSA
subset) and report on GIFT-Eval test. Everything else is caveat
territory.
