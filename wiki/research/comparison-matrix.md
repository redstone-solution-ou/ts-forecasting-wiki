# Comparison Matrix

This page puts the 19 papers side by side so that a researcher can see,
in one screen, which design choices have been tried and which
combinations are still empty. It is a map, not a ranking: the "Key
claim" column is the paper's own stated contribution, not a verdict on
it.

## How to read this matrix

- **Backbone family** is the architectural cluster
  ([../architectures/README.md](../architectures/README.md)) — decoder
  AR, masked encoder, encoder-decoder, MoE, LLM reprogramming,
  lightweight / SSM, flow matching.
- **Pretraining objective** is what the loss actually optimizes
  (next-patch point loss, next-token cross-entropy on a quantized vocab,
  masked reconstruction, flow matching, and so on).
- **Tokenization** is the input representation before the backbone
  sees it.
- **Param range** is the smallest to largest released variant.
- **Pretrain corpus** names the data; where the paper bundled a new
  corpus it is listed there.
- **Multivariate?** answers "can the model use multiple input channels
  natively, without per-channel re-training?"
- **Probabilistic?** answers "does the published model output a
  predictive distribution, not just a point?"
- **Open weights?** is Yes / No / Code only.
- **Key claim** is the paper's headline contribution in one phrase.

A dash ("—") means the paper does not state the value and it is not
general knowledge.

## Derived takeaways

- **Every billion-parameter TS-FM released so far is a sparse MoE.**
  Time-MoE and Moirai-MoE are the only two that clearly live above the
  billion-param mark; every dense open model is below 1B. That is a
  strong hint about what training budgets the dense recipes can afford.
- **Open-weights models are almost always masked-encoder or
  decoder-only.** Flow-matching (Sundial) has open weights but is
  alone in its family; the continuous generative direction is still
  one paper wide.
- **LLM reprogramming is code-only, not weight-only.** None of
  Time-LLM, GPT4TS or LLMTime ships a new pretrained artifact, because
  their contribution is a protocol on top of an existing LLM. This
  means "open code" does not give you something you can deploy
  off-the-shelf the way the HF checkpoints do.
- **Multivariate support is young and uneven.** Before Timer-XL,
  MOIRAI, Moirai-MoE and Chronos-2, every major TS-FM treated channels
  as independent. The multivariate recipes are also the ones that
  introduce the most idiosyncratic input interfaces, which is why
  cross-paper comparison is so hard in that regime.
- **Probabilistic output is no longer optional, but the head is not
  settled.** Categorical sampling, Student-t mixtures, quantile heads
  and flow matching all coexist, and different papers report different
  metrics for them.
- **Synthetic-only training is still a minority bet.** Mamba4Cast is
  the clearest pure example; Chronos's KernelSynth augments real data;
  every other model relies on real corpora. This is one of the
  highest-leverage unexplored combinations in the matrix.
