# Open Problems in Time-Series Foundation Models

This is the flagship page for anyone looking for a research topic. Each
section states the problem, sketches what has been tried, says what is
still unresolved, and lists two or three concrete directions a
contributor could pick up. Entries are deliberately biased toward
questions where an individual researcher or a small team can still move
the needle — none of them require a thousand-GPU run.

The state of play is as of 2026-04. The picture shifts quickly, so when
you start a project, first check whether a recent paper has already
closed the gap; the [reading-roadmap.md](reading-roadmap.md) and
[comparison-matrix.md](comparison-matrix.md) are the fastest way to do
that.

## 1. Scaling laws for time-series

**Background.** In language modeling, the Chinchilla work gave a clean
statement of joint data-and-parameter optimality and a rule of thumb
that training-compute-optimal LLMs are undertrained. Nothing equivalent
is settled for TS-FMs. Lag-Llama published the first empirical scaling
curves for a probabilistic decoder-only TS-FM. Time-MoE demonstrated
that a 2.4B sparse MoE on Time-300B keeps improving, and Chronos
reported monotonic gains from 20M to 710M parameters. But the exponents
differ between reports, the datasets differ, and no paper yet argues
that it has found the compute-optimal frontier.

**What is still open.** Is there a Chinchilla-equivalent law for TS-FMs?
Does the optimal data-to-parameter ratio depend on whether pretraining
data is real (LOTSA, Time-300B) or synthetic (Mamba4Cast-style PFN
priors, KernelSynth)? Does quantized-vocab training (Chronos) scale
differently from continuous-patch training (TimesFM, MOIRAI)? And what
is the right "tokens" unit — individual timesteps, patches, or
quantized codes?

**Directions a contributor could take.**
- Run a controlled three-axis sweep (params, data, context length) on a
  single corpus — LOTSA is the most defensible — and fit a joint law.
- Compare the fitted exponents for a decoder-only AR model, a masked
  encoder and a quantized-vocab T5, holding data fixed. This directly
  attacks the "does tokenization change the slope" question.
- Study whether synthetic-only pretraining has a fundamentally
  different scaling curve (e.g. saturation at low params) by reproducing
  Mamba4Cast at several sizes.

See [../concepts/scaling-laws.md](../concepts/scaling-laws.md).

## 2. True multivariate / covariate-informed forecasting

**Background.** Most TS-FMs were born univariate. MOIRAI's any-variate
attention and Timer-XL's flattened-token TimeAttention were the first
serious attempts to keep the channel dimension as a first-class citizen.
Chronos-2 pushed this further with group attention that lets the model
do in-context learning over related series at inference time. This is
arguably the most active frontier in 2025-2026: the best zero-shot
numbers on GIFT-Eval are now held by models that actively use related
series or exogenous variables, not by bigger univariate models.

**What has been tried.** Flattening channels into a single token stream
(Timer-XL), any-variate attention with learned channel identities
(MOIRAI), in-context grouping over related series (Chronos-2), and a
dedicated exogenous head on top of a lightweight backbone (TTM). Each
recipe handles some but not all of: irregular channel counts across
datasets, static covariates, known-future exogenous variables, and
cross-channel dependence.

**What is still open.** There is no agreed-upon interface for feeding a
model "here is the target, here are N related numerical series, here
are K static categorical covariates, here is a known-future calendar".
Every paper invents a slightly different scheme and then only evaluates
on datasets where that scheme is natural. The result is that we cannot
compare multivariate models cleanly.

**Directions.**
- Define and publish a benchmark protocol for covariate-informed
  forecasting with a fixed interface, and port three to five existing
  models to it.
- Probe whether any-variate attention actually learns cross-channel
  dependence or silently falls back to per-channel prediction
  (ablation: shuffle channels at inference).
- Extend Chronos-2's in-context group attention to irregular
  sampling and long contexts, the two cases its current training
  protocol does not stress.

[../concepts/in-context-learning.md](../concepts/in-context-learning.md).

## 3. Probabilistic calibration under distribution shift

**Background.** TS-FMs now produce probabilistic forecasts in roughly
three styles: categorical sampling over a quantized vocab (Chronos),
mixture-of-Student-t output heads (MOIRAI, Lag-Llama), quantile
decoders (Chronos-2, TTM). Flow matching (Sundial) is a fourth,
generative path. All of them report competitive CRPS / WQL on
in-distribution splits. Very little is known about calibration when the
test series comes from a domain not represented in pretraining.

**What has been tried.** TimeGPT-1 wraps conformal prediction around a
closed model to provide post-hoc calibrated intervals. MOIRAI and
Lag-Llama report interval coverage but only on their own splits.
Evaluation suites like GIFT-Eval track probabilistic metrics
per-dataset, not per-shift-type.

**What is still open.** Which head family is most robust to scale
shifts, regime changes, and seasonality the model has never seen? Does
RevIN-style per-instance normalization actually help calibration, or
does it just move the miscalibration into a less visible place? Is
post-hoc conformal wrapping strictly preferable to training-time
calibration for TS-FMs, as some recent LLM work suggests?

**Directions.**
- Build a shift-aware evaluation harness (scale shift, trend reversal,
  frequency change, new seasonality) on top of GIFT-Eval and re-score
  the four head families across the same backbone.
- Study whether conformal wrapping of a flow-matching TS-FM (Sundial)
  gives useful intervals, since the current Sundial paper does not.
- Reproduce the Student-t mixture output on a quantized-vocab backbone
  and ask whether the gain reported in MOIRAI transfers.

See [../concepts/probabilistic-forecasting.md](../concepts/probabilistic-forecasting.md).

## 4. Data — pretraining corpora are small, synthetic is unproven

**Background.** Every TS-FM paper opens with a variant of the same
sentence: "unlike NLP, the time-series community does not have an
internet-scale corpus." Time-300B is the largest published corpus at
the moment; LOTSA and the Time Series Pile are smaller. Even the
largest is orders of magnitude below modern LLM training token counts,
and the diversity is concentrated in a few high-frequency domains
(energy, web traffic, finance).

One reaction is synthetic-only pretraining: Mamba4Cast uses a
PFN-style prior to sample synthetic series and never touches real data,
and Chronos's KernelSynth augments a real corpus with Gaussian-process
synthetic draws. So far this is promising on small and medium
benchmarks but has not been pushed to the scale at which LLMs found
their Chinchilla curve.

**What is still open.** How far can synthetic-only training go? Which
real-data types matter most (i.e. if you had to drop one LOTSA cluster,
which would hurt least)? Can we get a "web-scale" TS corpus from
something like Common Crawl's embedded tables and sensor logs, and
would quality filtering look anything like LLM quality filtering?

**Directions.**
- Push Mamba4Cast or a similar PFN model to billion-parameter scale on
  pure synthetic data and compare to Time-MoE head-to-head on
  GIFT-Eval.
- Run a LOTSA-ablation study: drop one domain at a time and measure
  zero-shot regression.
- Build and release a new corpus (the "LOTSA-2") from a fresh domain
  source; this is low-glamour but high-value work.

See [../datasets-benchmarks/README.md](../datasets-benchmarks/README.md),
[../concepts/synthetic-data-augmentation.md](../concepts/synthetic-data-augmentation.md).

## 5. Efficient inference — when is small actually right?

**Background.** TTM showed that a 1-5M-parameter MLP-Mixer with
adaptive patching is competitive on many forecasting benchmarks and
runs on CPU. Mamba4Cast uses a state-space backbone for linear-time
inference. On the other end, Time-MoE ships 2.4B parameters and
Moirai-MoE routes tokens through a sparse expert pool to amortize
compute. There is no principled story about which regime fits which
deployment.

**What is still open.** Is the gap between TTM and Time-MoE a capacity
gap, a data gap, or a task-shape gap? At what horizon, at what channel
count, at what required accuracy, does the billion-parameter model
start paying for itself? Does sparse MoE actually provide a Pareto
improvement at inference, or is the reported speedup a training-side
number?

**Directions.**
- Measure a Pareto front: latency / memory / CRPS across TTM,
  Mamba4Cast, Chronos-small, MOIRAI-base, Time-MoE, Moirai-MoE, on one
  benchmark.
- Distill a large MoE into a TTM-sized student and see how much of the
  gap closes.
- Characterize when the MoE router actually fires diverse experts
  versus collapsing to one — an open question inherited from the LLM
  MoE literature.

See [../papers/ttm.md](../papers/ttm.md),
[../papers/mamba4cast.md](../papers/mamba4cast.md),
[../papers/time-moe.md](../papers/time-moe.md),
[../papers/moirai-moe.md](../papers/moirai-moe.md).

## 6. Long-horizon forecasting and autoregressive rollout error

**Background.** Decoder-only AR TS-FMs (TimesFM, Timer, Time-MoE,
Lag-Llama) generate long horizons by rolling out their next-patch
prediction repeatedly. Error compounds, and most papers paper over this
by training with an output-patch size larger than the input-patch size
(TimesFM's trick) or by masking large contiguous blocks during training
(MOIRAI, MOMENT). Sundial's flow-matching head produces the whole
horizon in one pass and sidesteps the rollout entirely; Mamba4Cast
similarly does single-pass horizon generation.

**What is still open.** On horizons of 1000+ steps, do single-pass
models strictly beat AR rollouts? Can we get the horizon-degradation
curve for every major TS-FM on the same benchmark? Is scheduled
sampling or teacher-forcing-free training the right fix for the AR
side?

**Directions.**
- Build a horizon-stress benchmark (same context, increasing horizon)
  and measure error growth across AR and single-pass models.
- Retrain a decoder-only model with scheduled sampling or exposure-bias
  correction and measure rollout improvement in isolation.
- Try hybrid decoders: autoregressive for the first N patches, flow
  matching for the tail.

## 7. Tokenization — no consensus

**Background.** The field has converged on "tokenize the series
somehow" but not on how. Patch embeddings (TimesFM, MOIRAI, MOMENT,
Chronos-2), value quantization to a fixed vocab (Chronos), numbers as
text (LLMTime), VQ-VAE codebooks (TOTEM), continuous flows (Sundial)
and flattened multivariate tokens (Timer-XL) all coexist. Each is
motivated by a different downstream need (probabilistic output,
multi-resolution handling, reuse of an LLM tokenizer, cross-domain
sharing).

**What is still open.** Nobody has a fair head-to-head between these
schemes with backbone and data held constant. The Chronos paper argues
quantization is fine; the TimesFM paper argues it is lossy; LLMTime
argues a text tokenizer is sufficient for zero-shot. None of these
claims have been cross-checked by a neutral team.

**Directions.**
- Fix the T5 backbone (to match Chronos) and swap tokenizers
  (quantized vocab, patch, VQ-VAE, text) on the same corpus; report
  CRPS, WQL, compute.
- Measure whether VQ codebooks transfer across domains (as TOTEM
  claims) by holding one domain out.
- Investigate hybrid tokenization: coarse-grained VQ for long-range
  context, fine continuous patches for short-range.

See [../concepts/patch-tokenization.md](../concepts/patch-tokenization.md),
[../concepts/value-quantization.md](../concepts/value-quantization.md).

## 8. Evaluation and benchmark contamination

**Background.** Zero-shot claims are only as strong as the guarantee
that the test series never appeared in pretraining. LOTSA, the Time
Series Pile and Time-300B all overlap with Monash and with the long-horizon
benchmarks used by the Autoformer / FEDformer era. Several papers
report "zero-shot" numbers on datasets that are demonstrably in their
training corpus. GIFT-Eval was introduced partly as a cleaner protocol,
but not every paper reports on it, and different papers quote
different splits.

**What is still open.** We do not have a community-agreed procedure
for proving a dataset is held out. Paper-reported zero-shot numbers are
therefore not directly comparable. Worse, the most popular benchmarks
(ETT, Weather, Traffic) have been used so aggressively that the
informative signal has eroded.

**Directions.**
- Write a leakage audit: for each of the 19 papers, check which
  benchmarks are trivially in-pretraining-corpus, and publish the
  table.
- Propose a cryptographic-style train-test hash protocol that a paper
  can adopt to credibly claim zero-shot on a dataset.
- Replace the legacy long-horizon benchmarks with clean holdouts from
  LOTSA-2 or a fresh corpus.

See [../datasets-benchmarks/gift-eval.md](../datasets-benchmarks/gift-eval.md).

## 9. Interpretability and anomaly attribution

**Background.** TS-FMs inherit the usual transformer-interpretability
toolkit (attention maps, probing classifiers), but time-series
forecasts have natural semantic handles — seasonality, trend, level —
that text does not. MOMENT is one of the few models to be evaluated on
anomaly detection as a first-class task. Very little work tries to
attribute "the model predicted this peak because of that historical
pattern".

**What is still open.** Can we decompose a TS-FM forecast into
attributions over (context position, channel, frequency band)? Do
patch-tokenized and quantized-vocab models yield fundamentally
different interpretability tools? Is the in-context attention in
Chronos-2 a natural attribution surface for "which related series drove
this prediction"?

**Directions.**
- Port LLM-style circuit analysis to a small TS-FM (TTM or
  Mamba4Cast) and look for heads that isolate trend vs seasonality.
- Build an anomaly-attribution benchmark and score the handful of
  TS-FMs that claim anomaly support.
- Study whether flow-matching models (Sundial) produce naturally
  calibrated uncertainty that can drive anomaly scores.
