# Reproducibility and Buildability

For each of the 23 papers on this wiki, the table below records what a
new researcher can actually get their hands on: open weights, training
code, training corpus, disclosed training cost, and deployment
footprint. Values are taken from the per-paper fact-sheet on this wiki;
where a value was not disclosed by the paper and is not general
knowledge, the cell is "—".

Training cost is notoriously under-reported in TS-FM papers, so most of
that column is "—". Do not read a dash as "cheap"; read it as "not
known".

## Reading the table

Three groups fall out:

- **Fully open and deployable.** TimesFM, Chronos, Chronos-2, MOMENT,
  MOIRAI, Moirai-MoE, Timer, Timer-XL, Lag-Llama, TTM, UniTS, TOTEM,
  Sundial, Mamba4Cast — weights on HuggingFace or equivalent, code
  available, and at least a documented pretraining recipe. A researcher
  can fine-tune any of these today.
- **Code-only, bring your own LLM.** Time-LLM, GPT4TS, LLMTime. You
  need a base LLM to run them; their contribution is the protocol, not
  an artifact. Treat them as baselines, not deployment targets.
- **Closed.** TimeGPT-1 is API-only. It is useful as a commercial
  benchmark but cannot be extended.

Training cost is the single most opaque column. Time-MoE is the only
paper that clearly crosses into "big run" territory; everything else is
plausibly reproducible on single-GPU or small multi-GPU budgets, which
is one of the most under-appreciated facts about TS-FMs.

## Good models to build on right now

If you are starting a project this week, these are the checkpoints with
the best ratio of capability to friction. If you are starting a *training
run* rather than a fine-tune, see
[../benchmarks/training-a-small-model.md](../benchmarks/training-a-small-model.md)
for the full recipe — corpus choice, curation pipeline, backbone and
head options, and the parameter-count brackets that define "small."

- **TTM** — for deployment-constrained work, CPU targets, or any
  project where you need to iterate fast. 1-5M parameters means you
  can fine-tune on a laptop. See [../papers/ttm.md](../papers/ttm.md).
- **Chronos (base or large) or Chronos-2** — for probabilistic
  forecasting where you need samples and quantiles out of the box.
  Chronos has clean value quantization; Chronos-2 is the current
  champion when you have related series. See
  [../papers/chronos.md](../papers/chronos.md) and
  [../papers/chronos-2.md](../papers/chronos-2.md).
- **MOIRAI / Moirai-MoE** — for multivariate zero-shot, especially
  when the number of channels varies between datasets. See
  [../papers/moirai.md](../papers/moirai.md) and
  [../papers/moirai-moe.md](../papers/moirai-moe.md).
- **MOMENT** — for multi-task work (forecast + classify + anomaly +
  impute from the same encoder). The released [Time Series Pile](../datasets-benchmarks/time-series-pile.md) is an
  independent bonus. See [../papers/moment.md](../papers/moment.md).
- **Time-MoE** — if you specifically want to study billion-parameter
  sparse MoE on TS. It is the only credible open artifact at that
  scale. See [../papers/time-moe.md](../papers/time-moe.md).
- **Mamba4Cast** — if your research question is about non-transformer
  backbones or synthetic-only training. It is the clearest open example
  of both bets. See [../papers/mamba4cast.md](../papers/mamba4cast.md).
