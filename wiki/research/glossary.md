# Glossary

Compact definitions for terms used across the wiki. One or two
sentences each, with cross-links to deeper pages where one exists.

- **Ablation.** A controlled experiment that removes a single component
  of a model to isolate its contribution. The gold standard of
  evidence in TS-FM papers.
- **Autoregressive rollout.** Generating a long horizon by feeding the
  model's own previous predictions back in as inputs. Compounds error
  with horizon length; see
  [open-problems.md](open-problems.md#6-long-horizon-forecasting-and-autoregressive-rollout-error).
- **Chinchilla.** The 2022 DeepMind scaling-law paper that argued
  compute-optimal LLMs are undertrained. No TS-FM equivalent is
  settled.
- **Context window.** The number of past timesteps (or patches) the
  model sees before forecasting.
- **Covariate.** An auxiliary variable associated with the target
  series (temperature alongside energy load, say). Static covariates
  are time-invariant; dynamic covariates change with time.
- **CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score).** A proper scoring rule
  for probabilistic forecasts; lower is better. The de facto standard
  metric for TS-FMs with distributional output. See
  [../concepts/probabilistic-forecasting.md](../concepts/probabilistic-forecasting.md)
  and the full definition in
  [../evaluation/metrics.md#21-crps--continuous-ranked-probability-score](../evaluation/metrics.md#21-crps--continuous-ranked-probability-score).
- **Decoder-only.** A transformer trained to predict the next token
  given its left context, without a separate encoder. The GPT
  recipe — and the pattern used by [TimesFM](../papers/timesfm.md), [Timer](../papers/timer.md), [Time-MoE](../papers/time-moe.md) and
  [Lag-Llama](../papers/lag-llama.md).
- **Encoder-only.** A transformer whose training signal is over the
  whole input, typically via masked reconstruction. [MOMENT](../papers/moment.md), [MOIRAI](../papers/moirai.md)
  and [Chronos-2](../papers/chronos-2.md) are encoder-only.
- **Exogenous variable.** A covariate that is known into the forecast
  horizon (a calendar, a pricing schedule). [TTM](../papers/ttm.md) explicitly supports
  exogenous heads.
- **Few-shot.** Fine-tuning or adapting a pretrained model on a small
  number of labeled examples from a new task.
- **Fine-tune.** Continuing training of a pretrained model on a target
  dataset, usually with a lower learning rate.
- **Flow matching.** A generative training objective that learns a
  continuous-time velocity field between noise and data. Used as the
  output head of [Sundial](../papers/sundial.md). See [../architectures/flow-matching-continuous.md](../architectures/flow-matching-continuous.md).
- **Gaussian process (GP).** A non-parametric probabilistic model over
  functions. Used in [Chronos](../papers/chronos.md)'s KernelSynth to generate synthetic
  training series.

  cleaner than the legacy long-horizon benchmarks. See
  [../datasets-benchmarks/gift-eval.md](../datasets-benchmarks/gift-eval.md).
- **Horizon.** The number of future timesteps to predict.
- **In-context learning.** The ability of a pretrained model to adapt
  at inference time from examples provided in its context, without
  gradient updates. Chronos-2 pushes this for TS. See
  [../concepts/in-context-learning.md](../concepts/in-context-learning.md).
- **LoRA.** Low-rank adaptation: a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
  scheme that trains a small low-rank delta on top of frozen weights.
- **LOTSA.** Large-scale Open Time Series Archive, ~27B observations,
  assembled by the MOIRAI team. See
  [../datasets-benchmarks/lotsa.md](../datasets-benchmarks/lotsa.md).
- **Mamba.** A selective state-space model architecture with linear
  scaling in sequence length. The backbone of [Mamba4Cast](../papers/mamba4cast.md).
- **MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error).** A scale-free point forecast
  metric; standard on the Monash archive. Full definition and pitfalls
  in [../evaluation/metrics.md#17-mase--mean-absolute-scaled-error](../evaluation/metrics.md#17-mase--mean-absolute-scaled-error).
- **Masked reconstruction.** A pretraining objective in which parts of
  the input are hidden and the model is trained to reconstruct them.
  The MOMENT, MOIRAI and [Moirai-MoE](../papers/moirai-moe.md) objective.
- **MoE (Mixture of Experts).** A sparse architecture that routes each
  token through a small subset of expert subnetworks. Time-MoE and
  Moirai-MoE are the two TS-FM examples.
- **Monash archive.** A long-standing collection of univariate
  forecasting benchmarks. See
  [../datasets-benchmarks/monash-archive.md](../datasets-benchmarks/monash-archive.md).
- **Multivariate.** A series with multiple channels that may interact.
  Distinct from "many univariate series".
- **Panel data.** A collection of related series (one per entity)
  observed over the same time window. Natural home for in-context
  learning over related series.
- **Patch.** A contiguous window of raw timesteps projected into a
  single token. See
  [../concepts/patch-tokenization.md](../concepts/patch-tokenization.md).
- **PFN (Prior-Fitted Network).** A model trained only on samples
  from a Bayesian prior, so that its forward pass approximates
  posterior inference. Mamba4Cast is the TS PFN.
- **Probabilistic forecast.** A forecast that outputs a predictive
  distribution (samples, quantiles, or a parametric family) rather
  than a single point. See
  [../concepts/probabilistic-forecasting.md](../concepts/probabilistic-forecasting.md).
- **Quantile loss.** The pinball loss used to train a quantile
  regression head. Minimized per quantile level. Full definition in
  [../evaluation/metrics.md#22-pinball--quantile-loss](../evaluation/metrics.md#22-pinball--quantile-loss).

  per-instance statistics before the model and reverse after. Used by
  MOMENT. See [../concepts/revin-normalization.md](../concepts/revin-normalization.md).

  size, data size, compute and loss. See
  [../concepts/scaling-laws.md](../concepts/scaling-laws.md).

  dynamics in a latent state; Mamba is a modern selective SSM.

  Student-t distribution (or a mixture thereof). Used by MOIRAI and
  Lag-Llama.

  a prior (KernelSynth, PFN priors, TSMix). See
  [../concepts/synthetic-data-augmentation.md](../concepts/synthetic-data-augmentation.md).

  Chronos reuses unchanged and MOMENT initializes from.
- **Teacher forcing.** Training an autoregressive model with the
  ground-truth previous token as input, rather than its own prediction.
- **Time Series Pile.** The corpus bundled with MOMENT. See
  [../datasets-benchmarks/time-series-pile.md](../datasets-benchmarks/time-series-pile.md).
