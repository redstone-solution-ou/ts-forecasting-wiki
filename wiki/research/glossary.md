# Glossary

Compact definitions for terms used across the wiki. One or two
sentences each, with cross-links to deeper pages where one exists.

- **Ablation.** A controlled experiment that removes a single component
  of a model to isolate its contribution. The gold standard of
  evidence in TS-FM papers.
- **Autoregressive rollout.** Generating a long horizon by feeding the
  model's own previous predictions back in as inputs. Compounds error
  with horizon length; see
  [open-problems.md](open-problems.md#6-long-horizon-forecasting-and-autoregressive-rollout-error).
- **Chinchilla.** The 2022 DeepMind scaling-law paper that argued
  compute-optimal LLMs are undertrained. No TS-FM equivalent is
  settled.
- **Context window.** The number of past timesteps (or patches) the
  model sees before forecasting.
- **Covariate.** An auxiliary variable associated with the target
  series (temperature alongside energy load, say). Static covariates
  are time-invariant; dynamic covariates change with time.
- **CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score).** A proper scoring rule
  for probabilistic forecasts; lower is better. The de facto standard
  metric for TS-FMs with distributional output. See
  [../concepts/probabilistic-forecasting.md](../concepts/probabilistic-forecasting.md)
  and the full definition in
  [../evaluation/metrics.md#21-crps--continuous-ranked-probability-score](../evaluation/metrics.md#21-crps--continuous-ranked-probability-score).
- **Decoder-only.** A transformer trained to predict the next token
  given its left context, without a separate encoder. The GPT
  recipe — and the pattern used by [TimesFM](../papers/timesfm.md), [Timer](../papers/timer.md), [Time-MoE](../papers/time-moe.md) and
  [Lag-Llama](../papers/lag-llama.md).
- **Encoder-only.** A transformer whose training signal is over the
  whole input, typically via masked reconstruction. [MOMENT](../papers/moment.md), [MOIRAI](../papers/moirai.md)
  and [Chronos-2](../papers/chronos-2.md) are encoder-only.
- **Exogenous variable.** A covariate that is known into the forecast
  horizon (a calendar, a pricing schedule). [TTM](../papers/ttm.md) explicitly supports
  exogenous heads.
- **Few-shot.** Fine-tuning or adapting a pretrained model on a small
  number of labeled examples from a new task.
- **Fine-tune.** Continuing training of a pretrained model on a target
  dataset, usually with a lower learning rate.

  scaling in sequence length. The backbone of [Mamba4Cast](../papers/mamba4cast.md).
- **MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error).** A scale-free point forecast
  metric; standard on the Monash archive. Full definition and pitfalls
  in [../evaluation/metrics.md#17-mase--mean-absolute-scaled-error](../evaluation/metrics.md#17-mase--mean-absolute-scaled-error).

  [../concepts/patch-tokenization.md](../concepts/patch-tokenization.md).
- **PFN (Prior-Fitted Network).** A model trained only on samples
  from a Bayesian prior, so that its forward pass approximates
  posterior inference. Mamba4Cast is the TS PFN.

  size, data size, compute and loss. See
  [../concepts/scaling-laws.md](../concepts/scaling-laws.md).
- **State-space model (SSM).** A recurrent family with linear
  dynamics in a latent state; Mamba is a modern selective SSM.

- **VQ-VAE.** Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder: learns a
  discrete codebook over a continuous input. Used as the tokenizer by
  [TOTEM](../papers/totem.md).
- **WQL (Weighted Quantile Loss).** A weighted version of the
  pinball loss used in probabilistic TS-FM leaderboards, notably by
  Chronos and Chronos-2. Full definition in
  [../evaluation/metrics.md#23-wql--weighted-quantile-loss](../evaluation/metrics.md#23-wql--weighted-quantile-loss).
- **Zero-shot.** Using a pretrained model on a new dataset without any
  fine-tuning at all. See
  [../concepts/zero-shot-forecasting.md](../concepts/zero-shot-forecasting.md).
- **BF16 / bfloat16.** 16-bit brain floating point. Used by Time-MoE,
  Moirai-MoE and Timer-S1 for training at billion-parameter scale;
  every other TS-FM in the wiki that discloses precision uses FP32.
- **Channel independence.** Treating a `C`-channel multivariate
  series as `C` univariate series sharing the same model weights.
  Standard in PatchTST, MOMENT and TTM pretraining; gives up
  cross-variate information in exchange for simplicity.
- **Exposure bias.** The gap between teacher-forced training inputs
  and rolled-out model-generated inputs at inference, which causes
  autoregressive decoders to drift at long horizons. TimesFM's
  `P_out > P_in` trick and Timer-S1's Serial-Token Prediction are
  different mitigations.
- **fev-bench.** A 100-task benchmark (Shchur et al. 2025,
  arXiv:2509.26468) split by [Chronos-2](../papers/chronos-2.md) §5.2
  into 32 univariate / 26 multivariate / 42 covariates analytic
  subsets; the first TS-FM benchmark to stress covariate-informed
  forecasting at scale.
- **Group attention.** The attention pattern in Chronos-2 that lets
  tokens at the same timestamp across series in a panel exchange
  information while preserving temporal causality within each
  series; memory is `O(V)` in the number of variates rather than
  `O(V^2)`. See
  [../concepts/in-context-learning.md](../concepts/in-context-learning.md).
- **Huber loss.** A robust regression loss that is quadratic near
  zero and linear in the tails; Time-MoE uses it as the
  point-regression objective to tolerate outliers in Time-300B.
- **Leakage.** A pretraining corpus containing datasets used for
  downstream evaluation, which invalidates zero-shot claims. Flagged
  explicitly by Moirai-MoE (Figure 3 asterisks) and by Chronos-2.
- **NLL (Negative log-likelihood).** The training objective for
  parametric probabilistic heads (Student-t, Gaussian, mixture); the
  probabilistic analog of MSE.
- **Pinball loss.** The quantile regression loss used to train
  quantile heads such as Chronos-2's 9-quantile decoder and
  Timer-S1's. See
  [../evaluation/metrics.md#22-pinball--quantile-loss](../evaluation/metrics.md#22-pinball--quantile-loss).
- **QK-Norm.** Per-head normalization of query and key vectors
  before the attention softmax. Used by Timer-S1 for stability at
  billion-parameter scale.
- **RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding).** A position-encoding scheme
  that rotates query and key vectors by angles proportional to their
  positions. Used by Sundial and Timer-S1; routinely absent from
  earlier TS-FMs.
- **Serial-Token Prediction (STP).** Timer-S1's training objective:
  a stack of shift-by-one prediction heads trained in parallel,
  each attending to the original lookback plus the previous block's
  hidden state. Replaces rolling next-token inference for multi-
  horizon outputs.
- **Skill score.** A normalized improvement metric,
  `1 - metric(model) / metric(baseline)` or a geometric-mean variant.
  GIFT-Eval and fev-bench report skill scores under WQL, MASE and
  SQL. Higher is better.
- **SQL (Scaled Quantile Loss).** The quantile-loss family used as
  fev-bench's probabilistic headline metric (Chronos-2, Table 3).
- **TiRex, TimesFM-2.5, Toto, Moirai-2.0.** 2025 successors or
  competitors that appear in Chronos-2's GIFT-Eval and fev-bench
  tables but do not yet have individual paper leaves in this wiki.
  They are present in the
  [leaderboard](../benchmarks/leaderboard.md) rows for
  comparability.
