# Time-Series Forecasting — Research Wiki

This repository organizes knowledge about time-series forecasting foundation
models as a navigable knowledge graph. It moves from general concepts (what
forecasting is, classical methods, the deep-learning era) down through
architecture families and cross-cutting technical ideas, all the way to the
individual research papers that sit as leaves of the graph. The goal is to
make it easy to locate a paper inside a broader intellectual context, to
compare approaches across clusters, and to understand how the field arrived
at the current wave of time-series foundation models (TS-FMs).

## Structure

- `papers/` — PDF leaves. One file per primary research paper, named by
  slug and arXiv id (for example `timesfm_2310.10688.pdf`,
  `chronos_2403.07815.pdf`). These are the empirical ground truth the wiki
  points at.
- `wiki/` — the markdown knowledge graph. Top-level folders are
  `foundations/`, `foundation-models/`, `architectures/`, `concepts/`,
  `datasets-benchmarks/`, and `papers/`. Every page links up to its parent
  section and across to related nodes so that a reader can walk the graph
  rather than hunt through a flat list.

## Reading the wiki: concept nodes as graph hubs

Most pages in the wiki are *leaves*: a single paper, a single dataset,
a single benchmark table. The wiki's structure is held together by a
smaller set of **concept nodes** that act as graph hubs. A concept
node is a page in `wiki/concepts/` (cross-cutting ideas),
`wiki/architectures/` (model families), or
`wiki/foundation-models/taxonomy.md` (the cluster hierarchy) whose
primary job is to compare, contrast, and bridge — not to introduce a
single artifact.

Three properties make a page a concept node:

- It defines an idea or a family that multiple papers instantiate
  differently.
- It points outward: it links to several leaves and to several other
  concept nodes, with the *why* of each link, not just the bare URL.
- It contains a comparative section ("design choices in the
  literature", "trade-offs and failure modes", "open questions") so
  that a reader who lands on it understands not just what the idea
  is, but how the candidates differ and which one to pick when.

The practical effect is that any leaf is reachable from a top-level
entry point — `wiki/overview.md`, `wiki/index.md`, or a section hub
— in two or three hops via concept nodes. A reader who arrives at
[overview.md](wiki/overview.md) wanting to understand JEPA-style
time-series models can follow it into
[foundation-models/taxonomy.md](wiki/foundation-models/taxonomy.md),
then into
[concepts/joint-embedding-predictive-architecture.md](wiki/concepts/joint-embedding-predictive-architecture.md),
then into
[papers/ts-jepa.md](wiki/papers/ts-jepa.md) — three hops, no dead
ends. The concept node carries the comparative content along the
way, so a reader picks up the *why* of each link rather than just
landing on a destination they have to interpret cold.

When adding a new paper, the workflow is: create the leaf, then
update the concept and architecture nodes it relates to so the new
entry joins the comparative discussions. Cross-link discipline
(minimum link counts per page type, comparative-section requirement)
is documented in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Start here

- [wiki/overview.md](wiki/overview.md) — the wiki entry point and map of the
  territory.
- [wiki/index.md](wiki/index.md) — flat catalog of every wiki page with
  a one-line gloss; the first stop when you know a topic but not where
  it lives.
- [wiki/log.md](wiki/log.md) — chronological append-only record of
  ingests, queries-filed-back, lint passes, refactors, and schema
  changes.
- [wiki/foundation-models/taxonomy.md](wiki/foundation-models/taxonomy.md) —
  the eight-cluster taxonomy that most other pages anchor into.
- [wiki/papers/papers.md](wiki/papers/papers.md) — index of the paper
  leaves, with one short page per paper.

## Section hubs

Every wiki section has a folder-note hub named after the section itself.
The full set, in reading order:

- [wiki/foundations/foundations.md](wiki/foundations/foundations.md) — classical and
  deep-learning precursors to TS-FMs.
- [wiki/foundation-models/foundation-models.md](wiki/foundation-models/foundation-models.md) —
  the TS-FM paradigm, its brief history, and the canonical eight-cluster
  taxonomy.
- [wiki/architectures/architectures.md](wiki/architectures/architectures.md) — the
  architecture-family pages (decoder-only, masked encoder, encoder-decoder,
  MoE, LLM reprogramming, lightweight, flow matching, JEPA / latent-target
  prediction).
- [wiki/concepts/concepts.md](wiki/concepts/concepts.md) — cross-cutting
  technical ideas shared across papers.
- [wiki/datasets-benchmarks/datasets-benchmarks.md](wiki/datasets-benchmarks/datasets-benchmarks.md) —
  pretraining corpora and shared evaluation suites.
- [wiki/benchmarks/benchmarks.md](wiki/benchmarks/benchmarks.md) — head-to-head
  performance tables and practical guides.
- [wiki/evaluation/evaluation.md](wiki/evaluation/evaluation.md) — metrics,
  protocols, baselines, and the per-paper methodology summary.
- [wiki/research/research.md](wiki/research/research.md) — the research
  corner: reading roadmap, open problems, comparison matrix,
  reproducibility table, contributing guide, glossary.
- [wiki/papers/papers.md](wiki/papers/papers.md) — the 26 TS-FM paper
  leaves plus 1 pre-FM precursor (TiDE).

## Scope (as of 2026-04)

The wiki covers 26 foundation-model papers published between 2023 and
early 2026, plus 1 pre-FM precursor (TiDE) that is repeatedly cited
as a design ancestor and full-shot baseline. The eight clusters in
[wiki/foundation-models/taxonomy.md](wiki/foundation-models/taxonomy.md)
span decoder-only autoregressive models, masked and encoder-decoder
models, mixture-of-experts variants, LLM-reprogramming approaches,
lightweight non-transformer models, multi-task universal models,
continuous / flow-matching forecasters, and the JEPA / latent-target
prediction family added in April 2026. Additions and corrections are
welcome via pull request; please follow the existing page layout and
link conventions.
