# Time-Series Forecasting — Research Wiki

This repository organizes knowledge about time-series forecasting foundation
models as a navigable knowledge graph. It moves from general concepts (what
forecasting is, classical methods, the deep-learning era) down through
architecture families and cross-cutting technical ideas, all the way to the
individual research papers that sit as leaves of the graph. The goal is to
make it easy to locate a paper inside a broader intellectual context, to
compare approaches across clusters, and to understand how the field arrived
at the current wave of time-series foundation models (TS-FMs).

## Structure

- `papers/` — PDF leaves. One file per primary research paper, named by
  slug and arXiv id (for example `timesfm_2310.10688.pdf`,
  `chronos_2403.07815.pdf`). These are the empirical ground truth the wiki
  points at.
- `wiki/` — the markdown knowledge graph. Top-level folders are
  `foundations/`, `foundation-models/`, `architectures/`, `concepts/`,
  `datasets-benchmarks/`, and `papers/`. Every page links up to its parent
  section and across to related nodes so that a reader can walk the graph
  rather than hunt through a flat list.

## Start here

- [wiki/README.md](wiki/README.md) — the wiki entry point and map of the
  territory.
- [wiki/foundation-models/taxonomy.md](wiki/foundation-models/taxonomy.md) —
  the seven-cluster taxonomy that most other pages anchor into.
- [wiki/papers/README.md](wiki/papers/README.md) — index of the paper
  leaves, with one short page per paper.

## Scope (as of 2026-04)

Version 0 of the wiki covers 19 foundation-model papers published between
2023 and 2025, spanning decoder-only autoregressive models, masked and
encoder-decoder models, mixture-of-experts variants, LLM-reprogramming
approaches, lightweight non-transformer models, multi-task universal
models, and the first continuous / flow-matching entrants. Additions and
corrections are welcome via pull request; please follow the existing page
layout and link conventions.
